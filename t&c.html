                <h4>Terms Of Service</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li>

                        The use of Websites Designed / Developed / Hosted / Maintained Supported by Sudozap
                        Technologies is subject to the Terms and
                        Conditions
                        mentioned hereunder. By accepting our services, you are agreeing to use the Service with
                        these
                        terms and conditions under all applicable laws and regulations.

                    </li>
                    <li>All services provided by Sudozp are valid for 1 Year only unless otherwise stated.</li>
                    <li>The service is for 1 year or any additional period that is paid for and thereafter, in case,
                        there is no renewal after paying the appropriate and required renewal fees, the Sudozap
                        Technologies services
                        will not be available to you. Sudozap Technologies will intimate you on the renewal of the
                        service that is due
                        but it is not the responsibility of Sudozap Technologies to give you such intimations in
                        advance. It is
                        confirmed by you that the responsibility of renewing the service will lie with you.
                    </li>
                    <li>Free maintenance of the website for 1st year includes minor changes only like correction of
                        small volume of wrong data. Addition of pages, layout changes, design changes or changing
                        complete data of an existing page would charge extra.
                    </li>
                    <li>In the event of non-payment of any services, Sudozap Technologies reserves the right to re-sell
                        the Domain,
                        Layout & all other related material to any third party or use itself, including the Domain/

                    <li>Customers are advised to maintain data backups on their home computers or CDs to ensure that
                        they have ready access to their data in case we have a hardware failure or any other accidental
                        issue. However, such cases are rare in occurrence, but cannot be avoided sometimes. This is why
                        we recommend all our clients to take regular backups for all their important e-mails and data by
                        forwarding mails to other domain email IDs or by using Outlook.

                    <li>We reserve the right to change prices listed on our site, and to increase/decrease the amount of
